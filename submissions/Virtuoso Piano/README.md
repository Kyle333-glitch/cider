**Name**: Virtuoso Piano

**Description**: What is this app? How does it help you? What problem does it solve for you and your friends?
Virtuoso Piano is a clean, lightweight piano app designed to be simple and intuitive, yet advanced and powerful. It helps me by giving me a portable instrument I can rely on anytime, even when I’m offline or don’t have access to a real piano. Unlike most piano apps, it doesn’t force me to subscribe, make in-app purchases, pay for downloading the app, or show distracting ads. _**TALK ABOUT PROBLEMS HERE**_ Overall, Virtuoso Piano solves the biggest problem with piano apps by removing the clutter, so that you can stay focused on music.
